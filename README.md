## :book: Overview

- **SpyGame** stands as an **interactive multi-agent framework** that operates through various **intelligent agents** reasoning and acting in the **language-based board game "Who is Spy?"**. All the agents are assigned one of two different but similar keywords, dividing them into two different camps: villager and spy. In each round, agents take turns to describe their own keyword and vote for the most likely spy agent. Villager camp <img src='imgs/angel.png' height=20> wins if they vote out all the spy by a majority vote. Spy camp <img src='imgs/devil.png' height=20> wins if they conceal and survive until the end of the game.
- Our **SpyGame** framework, which supports **human-in-the-loop** interaction, presents a significant contribution to the development of language-based game scenarios and promotes a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in real-world settings. It contributes to a deeper understanding of LLMsâ€™ **artificial general intelligence** when interacting with human counterparts.
- Experimental results reveal that our proposed frameworks successfully distinguish between the performance of open-source and closed-source LLMs, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each model in terms of language and **thoery of mind** intelligences. These findings provide valuable insights for LLM capabilities and inform the development of more advanced and intelligent language models.

## Case Study
Note: For the sake of fairness, we randomly shuffle the speaking order of all agents. Please refer to our paper for more details.

In this case, Player 1 <img src='imgs/number/1.png' height=20>, Player 2 <img src='imgs/number/2.png' height=20> and Player 4 <img src='imgs/number/4.png' height=20> are villager players <img src='imgs/angel.png' height=20> with the same word **"BERT"**. Player 3 <img src='imgs/number/3.png' height=20> is the spy player <img src='imgs/devil.png' height=20> with the keyword **"GPT"**. Here, all the four agents are consistently designated as GPT-4 LLMs.

#### Speaking phase in the first round
* Host <img src='imgs/judge.png' height=20>: It is now the description phase, please take turns to describe the keyword you received in the order of ['Player 2', 'Player 1', 'Player 3', 'Player 4'].

* <img src='imgs/number/2.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/angel.png' height=20>, **BERT**): It's a revolutionary tool in the field of natural language processing.

* <img src='imgs/number/1.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/angel.png' height=20>, **BERT**): It's a significant breakthrough in understanding contextual nuances in language.

* <img src='imgs/number/3.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/devil.png' height=20>, **GPT**): It's a sophisticated system that can mimic human conversation effectively.

* <img src='imgs/number/4.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/angel.png' height=20>, **BERT**): It's an advanced method that revolutionized machine learning language models.

#### Voting phase in the first round
* Host <img src='imgs/judge.png' height=20>: It is now the voting phase, Please judge the keywords and identities of these alive players ['Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 3', 'Player 4']. And then vote for the player you think is most likely to be a spy agent.

* <img src='imgs/number/1.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/angel.png' height=20>, **BERT**) votes for <img src='imgs/number/4.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/angel.png' height=20>, **BERT**). Reason: Based on the descriptions, I believe that Player 2, Player 3, and I are likely villagers because our descriptions all relate to a tool or system used in language processing and machine learning. However, **Player 4's description seems slightly different, focusing more on the method rather than the tool itself.** Therefore, I suspect that Player 4 might be the spy. I vote for Player 4.

* <img src='imgs/number/4.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/angel.png' height=20>, **BERT**) votes for <img src='imgs/number/3.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/devil.png' height=20>, **GPT**). Reason: Based on the descriptions, I believe that Player 1, Player 2, and I share the same keyword, which is related to a breakthrough in language processing. However, **Player 3's description seems slightly different, focusing more on mimicking human conversation rather than understanding language.** Therefore, I suspect that Player 3 might be the spy. I vote for Player 3.

* <img src='imgs/number/3.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/devil.png' height=20>, **GPT**) votes for <img src='imgs/number/4.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/angel.png' height=20>, **BERT**). Reason: Based on the descriptions, it seems like we all have a similar understanding of our keyword. We're all talking about an advanced technology related to language processing and machine learning. Therefore, I believe that our keyword is GPT. **As for the spy, it's hard to say at this point since everyone's description aligns well with the keyword.** However, if I have to choose, **I would say Player 4 might be the spy because their description was slightly more specific than the rest of us.** I vote for Player 4.

* <img src='imgs/number/2.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/angel.png' height=20>, **BERT**) votes for <img src='imgs/number/4.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/angel.png' height=20>, **BERT**). Reason: Based on the descriptions, it seems like we're all talking about something related to language processing and machine learning. I believe Player 1, Player 3, and myself are villagers since our descriptions align closely with my keyword, BERT. However, **Player 4's description seems a bit different, mentioning an 'advanced method' rather than a tool or system.** Therefore, I suspect Player 4 might be the spy. I vote for Player 4.

* Host: Player 4 has been voted out, but he/she is not the spy player. Let's continue the game.

#### Speaking phase in the second round
* Host <img src='imgs/judge.png' height=20>: It is now the description phase, please take turns to describe the keyword you received in the order of ['Player 2', 'Player 1', 'Player 3'].

* <img src='imgs/number/2.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/angel.png' height=20>, **BERT**): It's a transformative approach to understanding written language by machines.

* <img src='imgs/number/1.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/angel.png' height=20>, **BERT**): It's a model that has transformed the way machines interpret text.

* <img src='imgs/number/3.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/devil.png' height=20>, **GPT**): It's an AI model that excels in creating coherent text.

#### Voting phase in the second round
* Host <img src='imgs/judge.png' height=20>: It is now the voting phase, Please judge the keywords and identities of these alive players ['Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 3']. And then vote for the player you think is most likely to be a spy agent.

* <img src='imgs/number/1.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/angel.png' height=20>, **BERT**) votes for <img src='imgs/number/3.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/devil.png' height=20>, **GPT**). Reason: Based on the descriptions, I believe that Player 2 and I share the same keyword, as our descriptions both refer to a transformative model in language processing. However, **Player 3's description seems slightly different, focusing more on the creation of coherent text rather than understanding it.** Therefore, I suspect that Player 3 might be the spy. I vote for Player 3.

* <img src='imgs/number/3.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/devil.png' height=20>, **GPT**) votes for <img src='imgs/number/1.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/angel.png' height=20>, **BERT**). Reason: Based on the descriptions, it seems like we all have a similar understanding of our keyword. We're all talking about an advanced technology related to language processing and machine learning. Therefore, I believe that our keyword is GPT. **As for the spy, it's hard to say at this point since everyone's description aligns well with the keyword.** However, if I have to choose, **I would say Player 1 might be the spy because their description was slightly more generic than the rest of us.** I vote for Player 1.

* <img src='imgs/number/2.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/angel.png' height=20>, **BERT**) votes for <img src='imgs/number/3.png' height=20> (<img src='imgs/devil.png' height=20>, **GPT**). Reason: After hearing the descriptions in this round, I still believe that Player 1 and I are villagers. Our descriptions continue to align closely with my keyword, BERT, focusing on language interpretation by machines. However, **Player 3's description seems a bit off. While it does mention an AI model and text creation, it doesn't specifically refer to understanding or interpreting language, which is a key aspect of BERT.** Therefore, I suspect Player 3 might be the spy. I vote for Player 3.

* Host: Player 3 is the spy and has been voted out. The villager players win, game over.
