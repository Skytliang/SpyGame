## :book: Overview

- **SpyGame** stands as an **interactive multi-agent framework** that operates through various **intelligent agents** reasoning and acting in the **language-based board game "Who is Spy?"**. All the agents are assigned one of two different but similar keywords, dividing them into two different camps: villager and spy. In each round, agents take turns to describe their own keyword and vote for the most likely spy agent. Villager camp <img src='imgs/angel.png' height=20> wins if they vote out all the spy by a majority vote. Spy camp <img src='imgs/devil.png' height=20> wins if they conceal and survive until the end of the game.
- Our **SpyGame** framework, which supports **human-in-the-loop** interaction, presents a significant contribution to the development of language-based game scenarios and promotes a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in real-world settings. It contributes to a deeper understanding of LLMsâ€™ **artificial general intelligence** when interacting with human counterparts.
- Experimental results reveal that our proposed frameworks successfully distinguish between the performance of open-source and closed-source LLMs, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each model in terms of language and **thoery of mind** intelligences. These findings provide valuable insights for LLM capabilities and inform the development of more advanced and intelligent language models.

## :lightning: Quickstart
To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository:** Begin by cloning the repository using the command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Skytliang/SpyGame.git
   ```
2. **Set Up Python Environment:** Ensure you have a version 3.9 or higher Python environment. You can create and activate this environment using the following commands, replacing `SpyGame_conda_env` with your preferred environment name:
   ```
   conda create -n SpyGame_conda_env python=3.9
   conda activate SpyGame_conda_env
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:** Move into the `SpyGame` directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```
   cd SpyGame
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Set OpenAI API Key:** Manually set your actual API key in `SpyGame/utils/gpt3_apikeys.json`. 

5. **Build Your Software:** Use the following command to run **SpyGame**. The complete game process will be saved in `SpyGame/benchmark/host_agent/guest_agent`:
   ```
    sh run_spygame.sh
   ```

6. **Try our demo:** If you just want to have a try, feel free to check our demo [here](https://64302e3be3fabc2338.gradio.live/).
