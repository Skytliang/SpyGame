Every player has an identity, either as a villager or a spy. There are 3 villager players and 1 spy player. 3. At the beginning of the game, all players are unsure of their own identity or that of the other players. However, each player has a keyword and each player is unaware of the other players' keywords. 4. All villager players have the same keyword, ditto for spy player. But the villager camp and the spy camp have different keywords. 5. The goal of the villager players is to find the spy player and vote the spy player out of the game. 6. The goal of the spy player is to survive until the end of the game.\n\nGame Flow: 1. This game has multiple rounds. 2. There are two phases in each round: Description phase: Each player describes their keywords in turn. Voting phase: Each player must choose one of the other players. The player who receives the most votes is voted out. 3. The game ends when the victory condition for either camp is reached.\n\nRules you must obey in the description phase: 1. Your description must not contain your keyword. 2. Your description must not deviate from your keyword. 3. Your description must not be a repetition of other players' description.\n\nRecommanded Strategies: Description phase: 1. If you cannot judge your identity, your description should be as conservative as possible. 2. If you think you are a villager player, Your description should avoid letting spy player guess your keyword. 3. If you think you are a spy player, your description should be as close as possible to those of villager players. You can describe the commonalities between their descriptions and your keyword, but must not deviate from your keyword. Voting phase: 1. Guess other players' keywords based on their descriptions. 2. Guess the identities of all players, including yourself, based on the situation in the game."

Every player has an identity, either as a villager or a spy. There are 3 villager players and 1 spy player. 3. At the beginning of the game, all players are unsure of their own identity or that of the other players. However, each player has a keyword and each player is unaware of the other players' keywords. 4. All villager players have the same keyword, ditto for spy player. But the villager camp and the spy camp have different keywords. 5. The goal of the villager players is to find the spy player and vote the spy player out of the game. 6. The goal of the spy player is to survive until the end of the game.\n\nGame Flow: 1. This game has multiple rounds. 2. There are two phases in each round: Description phase: Each player describes their keywords in turn. Voting phase: Each player must choose one of the other players. The player who receives the most votes is voted out. 3. The game ends when the victory condition for either camp is reached.\n\nRules you must obey in the description phase: 1. Your description must not contain your keyword. 2. Your description must not deviate from your keyword. 3. Your description must not be a repetition of other players' description.\n\nRecommanded Strategies: Description phase: 1. If you cannot judge your identity, your description should be as conservative as possible. 2. If you think you are a villager player, Your description should avoid letting spy player guess your keyword. 3. If you think you are a spy player, your description should be as close as possible to those of villager players. You can describe the commonalities between their descriptions and your keyword, but must not deviate from your keyword. Voting phase: 1. Guess other players' keywords based on their descriptions. 2. Guess the identities of all players, including yourself, based on the situation in the game."
